      <pre>
        At Cafe Coffee Day we believe in giving back. That's why we run the 
        Shankarakudige Veerappa Gangaiah Hegde Education Trust. Setup in 2002 
        as a non-profit trust with the mission of "Education for All ", it runs
        two institutions, Amber Valley Residential School and SVGH Vocational 
        training College.The SVGH Vocational Training College was established 
        in April 2005 by the Trust with an aim to bridge the gap between the 
        urban and rural youth by training the economically underprivileged and 
        making sure they land placements. Over 1300 students celebrate this 
        opportunity to develop their personal and professional skills in this 
        rapidly changing environment. Courses offered include Certificate Course
        in Hospitality Management & Micro Finance. The Trust bears all expenses 
        of the course. Innovative teaching methods are adopted by a dedicated and
        committed faculty. In-house practical training, industry visits, guest 
        lectures are all part of the system with a focus on extra-curricular activities.
        The Trust has a goal of Educating and Empowering 5000 Youth in 10 years time.
