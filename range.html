<b>CAFE COFFEE DAY - A LOT CAN HAPPEN OVER COFFEE</b><br>
            Café Coffee Day, a coffee shop filled with fun, young energy and 
            lots of entertainment! Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide

            Brigade Road in Bangalore and continues to be one of the most happening 
            places in the city. The youth and the young at heart immediately took to 
            the place. A space that they call their own for a while, sit down, talk 
            and listen to conversations, hold short meetings and mainly have a whole
            lot of fun over steaming cups of endless coffee. It's been an exciting
            journey since then, becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in
            the country. If your travels take you to Austria, Czech Republic or Malaysia
            do stop by our outlets there to get a taste from back home.

            <br><b>COFFEE DAY HOTELS & RESORTS</b><br>
            2008 was a landmark year for Coffee Day Global Limited. At this point of time, we decided 
            to invite our friends and extended family to the coffee estates themselves to experience,
            first-hand, the serene slopes on which their coffee grew. Coffee Day Hotels & Resorts was 
            formed as a subsidiary of Coffee Day Global Limited, the Chikmagalur resort of The Serai 
            was declared open.The philosophy was single-minded - to open exclusive retreats in the 
            quietest corners of the country and to offer an experience drenched in luxury and understated
            elegance. It is a place where one would come to be pampered like nowhere else. The Serai, 
            Chikmagalur, as the first such resort did this job brilliantly, nestled as it was in the greens 
            of the lush coffee plantations around. The concept was so appreciated that we took these resorts
            to other reclusive niches – to Bandipur and Kabini.
